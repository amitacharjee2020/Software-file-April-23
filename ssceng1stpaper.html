<button class="accordion" >1.A winter Morning</button>
<div class="panel">
 <p> Winter is the coldest season in our country.
 It is usually foggy. Everything looks hazy Sometimes the fog is so dense that nothing can be seen even at a little distance. Everything looks hazy. Nature looks gloomy.
 The chirping of the birds is not heard. 
 The animals cannot come out of their shelters due to dense fog.
 Dense fog causes disruption to the communication system.
 Dew drops fall at night. Sometimes cold waves blow.
 It causes much sufferings to the children, the sick people, the aged people and the poor class.
<br> People put on different kinds of warm clothes to protect themselves from cold. 
Little boys & girls wrap their hands & legs in cold spell. 
The old people and children shiver in cold. 
They gather straw and make fires at different places to warm themselves in the heat.
 Most people do not feel like leaving the bed early.
 Sometimes village people spend the winter morning by gossiping.  In towns, rich people read newspaper in balcony. They drink warm tea while reading newspaper & enjoy sunbath.  The scene of the winter morning vanishes as the day advances.  In winter the days are shorter and the nights are longer. A winter night is more painful than a winter morning. A winter morning brings pains & sufferings to the rootless poor people. In spite of the dark sides of a winter morning we always welcome it because it is rich with varieties of food such as date juice, fresh vegetables and some other things. Villagers make fire with straw to warm themselves. Various kinds of pithas are made in this season. In a winter morning pitha parban is held in towns where the town folk enjoy winter food. A winter morning is not an unmixed blessing. In a winter morning, people go through different experiences according to their economic background. Those who are poor cannot afford warm cloths and so they suffer from the bitter cold. But the rich people enjoy sleep or staying under warm blanket. In cities & towns, different groups of people go picnic in remote areas & enjoy the winter morning in a different way.  So, to the poor the sun-ray becomes more precious than gold. In fact, people of all walks of life enjoy a winter morning despite some natural hazards like cold spell, dense fog etc. Many pitha  festivals are held throughout the country in  winter as the people of our country are fest lovers traditionally. The winter season is always welcome to the people of our country irrespective of class distinction.

<button class="accordion" >2.Deforestation</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Deforestation means cutting down trees in large numbers.  It is a process where a forest becomes a non-forest.  There is no denying the fact that deforestation has become a global concern in the present world. Forests are a rich resource of our planet earth. Therefore, it is important to protect our environment. Forests have a great floral diversity. There are large trees, creepers & climbers, grasses, shrubs & bushes that grow in forests. Forests are also habitats to many wild species. A large variety of animals, birds, reptiles and insects live in forests. Forests provide sustenance to many living beings including man. There are many  causes of deforestation. Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world. Its population is much more in proportion to its area. This huge number of population needs more shelter, agricultural land, fuel, furniture etc. For all these reasons, people cut down trees. Man depends on forests for food & livelihood. As farmers need more land for cultivation, they cut down trees to expand their agricultural land.  People also cut trees for habituation. They cut down trees for timber which is used as fuel, for  construction or to make furniture. Deforestation has very drastic effects on both humans and nature. Decreasing  the number of the trees leads to rising carbon-di-oxide and lack of oxygen in the atmosphere. Deforestation results in severe health hazards like  lung diseases,  bronchitis & other respiratory diseases  in humans and animals. All living beings need water. Loss of forest leads to ecological imbalance. Deforestation is one of the major factors leading to the greenhouse effect and desertification. Moreover, there are some greedy people who cut down trees in our forests to make money. The effects of deforestation are too many to describe. This destruction disturbs our ecological balance. Due to deforestation carbon-dioxide is increasing worldwide. As a result, the world is becoming warmer. The sea level is rising. On the other hand, new areas of the world are turning into deserts as a result of deforestation. The removal of trees causes serious damage to the soil. The temperature will rise and it will cause green house effect. The country will be unsuitable for living.  Ecological balance is also disturbed by deforestation. Many wild animals and birds, as well as beasts, lose their home. Global warming is an alarming consequence of deforestation. If we destroy trees at random, one day the country will turn into a great desert. There will be no rain and  our agricultural will face a great crisis As a result temperature of the atmosphere is increasing and ice of the polar region is melting very fast. For this, we have to face various devastating floods. Drought may occur due to deforestation. Our government should take immediate measures to prevent deforestation.

<button class="accordion">3.Environment pollution</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The world is producing millions of tons of domestic rubbish and toxic industrial waste each year, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to find suitable locations to get rid of all the refuse. The disposal of various kinds of waste is seriously polluting the environment. Air is an important element of our environment and our air is polluted by smoke. Man makes fires to cook food, make bricks, melt tar for road construction and to do many other things. Fires create smoke and pollute the air. Railway  engines and powerhouses create smoke by burning coal and oil. Mills and factories also belch a lot of smoke. Buses, trucks and cars use petrol and diesel oil. These too emit smoke. All these kinds of smoke pollute the air. Water, another vital element of the environment, is also polluted in different ways. Man pollutes water by throwing waste into it. Farmers use chemical fertilizers and insecticides in their fields. When rain and floods wash away some of these chemicals, they get mixed with water in rivers, canals and ponds. Mills and factories also throw their poisonous chemicals and waste products into rivers and canals and thus pollute the water. Water vehicles also pollute rivers by dumping oil, food waste and human waste into them. Every year millions of people all over the world die unnecessarily as a result of pollution. These unfortunate and avoidable deaths are brought about  by four specific factors. Firstly, air pollution from factories, burning trash, and vehicle fumes cause pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory diseases. Then, water pollution from industrial discharge. the indiscriminate disposal of toxic chemicals, and the dumping of human waste into rivers and canals causes poisoning and water-borne diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea. The next factor is the noise pollution from vehicle horns and microphones that might cause aggression and damage hearing. And finally, odour pollution from dumped or untreated human waste causes serious discomfort to our sense of smell, and attracts disease-bearing creatures such as rats and flies. We should take  determined action to control these problems and clean up the environment to avert these unnecessary diseases.

<button class="accordion" >4.A day labourer</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There is no single definition to describe a day labourer. But the word that comes to us about a day labourer is someone who works manually from early morning till  late evening on a daily basis. In short, a day labourer is he who does heavy manual labour in various fields. He belongs to the marginalized class. He belongs to ultra-poor group.  In most cases, he is unskilled or semi-skilled.  He does not enjoy due social status though he deserves it  and his labour is also  indispensible for the economic development of a country. A day labourer is a known face to all of us as he is required in our daily life. Naturally he is to be healthily, strong and stout  due to the nature of his job.  He lives with his family in a slum. He gets up early in the morning and goes out in search of work. He works hard from dawn to dusk for his employer and gets his wages at evening. He does different types of jobs such as carrying bricks, wood, stones, mud and digging ponds, constructing of roads, buildings etc. Sometimes he and his family pass a day without food if he cannot manage work. However, he is in great demand in harvesting season. . When he earns much money, he and his family can eat well. It is a happy day for them. If he does not find any work, he and his family have to go without food. So the life of a day labourer is very miserable. Sorrows and sufferings are his constant companions. He does not know what joy and happiness are. He earns his living by working hard. Most of the time he is ill- paid and ill- treated in every sphere of his life. In fact, the services of a day laborer plays an importance role in our national life. So we should think about his rights and show respect to them.

<button class="accordion" >5.Price-hike</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Price rise is a great problem of the day. It is a common phenomenon not only in our country but also in the world. Today the prices of necessary things such as food items, cloths, education materials, medicine and many other necessary things are going up by leaps and bounds. Price rise is caused by several factors like hoarding, population explosion, low productivity, natural calamities, wars, backwardness of communication, evil motives of dishonest businessmen, smuggling, black marketing etc. If the price rise is caused by the short supply of commodities, it is temporary. But it is very difficult to control the price rise caused by inflation. However, the people of low income suffer greatly and pass their days in constant anxiety. They find it, difficult to make their both ends meet. price hike is a function of multifarious factors such as energy costs, declining dollar value, rising demand for bio-fuel, export restrictions on food grains, carrying cost, climate change, etc. Concerns over oil prices, energy security and climate change have prompted governments to encourage production and use of bio-fuel. The price rise has widened the gap between the export and import value in the food grain importing countries which has affected the terms of trade and foreign exchange reserve. The fiscal impact of this price hike leads to the reduction of taxes on food grain import and a rise in subsidies in the production of the same Price rise has terrible effects on man’s character. It leads people to the path of corruption and moral degradation. The situation is complex and there is no single solution to this problem. The government should perform more efficiently and has to take actions so that the market performs properly. Bangladesh imports a lion’s share of its import of rice from India at low cost. In Bangladesh, the main sources of calorie are rice and wheat. In spite of a rise in wheat and rice price, people still consume rice and wheat. Therefore, the food price rise affects the poor extensively. Food crisis is a national as well as an international problem.  To reduce the extent of the effect of the crisis, some short term and long term measures can be taken. The government should begin selling rice from its stock and import food grains right at this moment to keep the local market stable. The dependency on private food importers should be lessened to avoid the artificial volatility of the local markets. Increasing the adoption of hybrid rice, improving crop management practices and access to high quality seed are essential. Deepening fertilizer dealer network to improve timely access to fertilizer and focusing on high quality seed availability are also needed.. Laws should be enforced strictly to bring the prices of the essential commodities within the purchasing capacity of the common people.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>Food Adulteration refers to the process by which the quality or the nature of a given food is reduced through addition of adulterants or removal of vital substance. Unsafe levels of pesticides are present  in around half of the vegetables and more than a quarter of fruits sold in the capital’s markets, a recent survey has found. The survey report, read that nearly 40% of 82 samples of milk, milk products, fish, fruits and vegetables contained banned pesticides such as DDT, Aldrin, Chlordane and Heptachlor. The amounts of pesticide in these samples were found to be 3 to 20 times greater than the limits set by the European Union. Around 50% vegetables and 35% fruits were found to be contaminated with unsafe level of pesticides. Using a sensitive High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method developed by the Food Safety Lab, 66 samples were analysed for the presence of formaldehyde. Adulteration was thereby detected in samples of coriander, mango and fresh shrimps. The tests indicated that poultry feed in the country had also been contaminated, as samples of chicken and fish contained traces of antibiotics. High microbial populations were found in several samples of pasteurised milk, indicating poor processing procedures by the manufacturers. Samples of cucumber and street foods also showed high microbial populations, suggesting widespread contamination in the water supply. Adulterated food products are reportedly the cause behind thousands of people suffering from fatal diseases like cancer, kidney failure and heart problems. Better monitoring and supervision were mandatory for stopping food adulteration.</p>

<button class="accordion">8.A street hawker</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A street hawker is a very common man in our society. Usually he moves from place to place to sell his goods. In fact, a street hawker is a very simple man. He is very poor and humble. He is a shabby man. He is a small trader. The capital of his business is very small. He lives from hand to mouth. Every morning he goes out to sell his goods carrying them either on his hand or in a cart or van. Throughout the day, he sells his goods shouting at the top of his voice to draw the attention of his customers. A the end of the day, he returns home with  the marginal profit gained from the sold goods. Again he goes out for the next day and returns home almost in the same way. Truly speaking, he leads his life in the vicious cycle of poverty. In fact, there is no liver lining in his life. He finds it very difficult to maintain his family. He can’t afford to meet the basic needs of life. Basically, he adopts a technique to sell his goods. He applies his skill to motivate or convince his customers especially women & children who are his first priority. It is true that the importance of a hawker goes unnoticed in our society. The fact is that he belongs to the marginalized class and his business is so petty that it is not included in the mainstream economy. Still he is part & parcel of our society. So we should have positive mindset for him</p>

<button class="accordion" >9.Traffic jam</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Traffic jam means a long line of vehicles that cannot move or that can move very slowly. It is a common affair in the big cities of our country. We’ve all experienced being stuck in a traffic jam, a stream of cars for miles ahead of us and behind us. Lack of co-ordination among government organizations and haphazard public transport system which includes lack of provision for pedestrians and poor maintenance and management of footways are the root cause of traffic jam. Rapid growth of population and the increasing number of vehicles are also the causes of traffic jam. Vehicles are much more than the roads can accommodate. The indiscriminate playing of rickshaw is another cause of it. Haphazard parking, more private vehicles, violation of traffic rules, faulty road construction, haphazard crossing, VIP movement, over population, rail crossing and fuel station are also the causes of traffic jam in the big cities city. Traffic jam causes untold sufferings to people. Sometimes it raises our tension. Transport and urban experts think the government should take pragmatic steps to ensure sufficient mass transport, restore discipline in the transport sector, reduce the use of private and small vehicles, replace the microbuses and minibuses with single-decker, double-decker and articulated buses and expand the capital city to significantly ease the traffic jam without spending huge money. The railways and waterways can also be used effectively to ease traffic pressure on roads and facilitate the commuters hassle-free transportation services. We have built over a half dozens of flyovers, but it is not a solution to the problem. It will not be possible to reduce traffic jam without increasing public transport and ensuring better traffic management. It is also necessary to implement all mass transit-related projects with high priority to improve traffic situation.</p>

<button class="accordion" >10.Load-shedding</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The term ‘load shedding’ means the state of being no electricity due to demand supply gap of power for a certain period in a certain area. The energy infrastructure of Bangladesh is quite small, insufficient and poorly managed. Electricity is the major source of power for most of the economic activities of a country. In generating & distributing power, the failure to adequately manage the loads leads to load-shedding which causes severe disruption in the industrial production and other economic activities. Inefficient distribution system is a major hurdle in delivering power. It is estimated that the total transmission and distribution losses in Bangladesh amount to one-third of the total generation. The process of upgrading the grid technology to digital smart metering system is going on throughout the country to reduce system loss. It will reduce power cuts and provide stability to the power sector. Radio technology can be operated remotely to maintain multiple power flow lines with automated control & digital metering. Load shedding causes multiple hazards in our socio-economic life. During load shedding the whole area plunges into darkness. Houses, shops, mills, factories, hospitals & almost all infrastructures are paralyzed for the time being. Students cannot prepare their lessons. Doctors cannot operate upon emergency patients in hospitals. Mills & factories cannot run their machines. Farmers cannot operate their agricultural tools in corn fields. Everything comes to a stand-still due to load-shedding. So, pragmatic steps should be taken to reduce system loss & keep load shedding at a tolerable level. The old power plants should be replaced. Nuclear plant is the best solution to power crisis to  meet the growing demand of the consumers. Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant is an under construction nuclear power plant in our country. It is expected that power crisis is going to be solved in Bangladesh.</p>

A month-long book fair is held on the premises of Bangla Academy highlighting the significance of Bangla, Bengali culture & literature especially focusing on 21st February. This is why, through-out the month of February, Ekushe Boi Mela is held each year. The leading publishers of the country set up stalls to sell and display their recent publications as well as the old ones. Various kinds of novels, poetry, science fictions etc are available in a book fair. A festive look prevails all around. The renowned artists, poets & intellectuals gather there & take part in the seminars & cultural programs. This year I have got an opportunity to visit the book fair held on the Bangla Academy premises where the book- lovers thronged to browse the latest editions & collections of various books published by different publishers of the country. I was accompanied by my father who bought me two novels, a comic book, a travel book and some other science fictions. I got excited to have all these books. It is a memorable day in my life. The day brought me very close to the authors and poets of the country. Last but not the least, the book fair brought much pleasure for me

<div class="panel">
<p>A road accident is the most vulnerable, unexpected incident in human life. It is a regular phenomenon in the highways and cities of our country. Every year it kills hundreds of lives. In Bangladesh, every day we find the news of road accidents in our daily newspapers and on television screen . It really makes us very shocked. Last month I saw a tragic road accident. It occurred in Mirpur Road near the Kolabagan Bus Stand. When I was standing on the road and waiting for the bus, I saw a little boy trying to cross the busy road. While crossing the road, the ill-fated boy was run over by a speedy truck When he was taken to the hospital, the doctor declared him dead. I cannot forget the tragic accident. A number of factors are responsible for road accidents in our country. First of all, the roads and streets of our country are narrow. These streets are not straight as there are frequent turnings at short distances. Reckless driving often causes road accidents. Besides, drivers are careless about the traffic rules and regulations. They recklessly drive their vehicles. Most of the drivers are not well- trained and in addition , they have not any adequate knowledge of the traffic system. Last but not the least, the pedestrians are also responsible for street accidents. They cross roads here and there. To save the pedestrians, drivers sometimes lose control and consequently accidents occur. Moreover, the condition of all vehicles is not up to the mark. So, plying of these defective vehicles is another factor of street accident. However, road accidents cause irreparable loss and injure. The effect of a road accident is too pathetic to describe. People lose their near and dear ones forever. The injured people due to accidents become a burden to the family. To control road accident, the defective vehicles should not be allowed to ply on the roads. Reckless driving should also be severely dealt with. Streets and roads should be expanded. Not only that, proper planning is needed at the time of constructing roads. Modern and scientific traffic system should be introduced in towns and cities. Last of all, the driving license should be issued after proper training and test. If all these steps can be taken properly, it will help to minimize road accidents. Above all, the people should be made aware of the bad consequences of road accident to control it to a great extent.</p>

Drug addiction is basically a brain disease that changes the functioning of brain. There is an uncontrollable desire to consume drugs, as a result of which addicted people engage in compulsive behavior to take drugs. The addicts find it impossible to control the intake of drugs, as a result of which they fail to fulfill day-to-day responsibilities in efficient manner. Drug addiction is also referred as drug dependency, as the addict develops dependency for particular substance.
The most common signs and symptoms of drug addiction are – obsession with a particular substance, loss of control over the usage of drugs, abandoning the activities which you used to enjoy, etc. Drug addiction may have long term impact on life and one may develop severe symptoms such as – fatigue, trembling, depression, anxiety, headache, insomnia, chills and sweating, paranoia, behavior changes, dilated pupils, poor coordination problems, nausea etc.
Though there is no scientific evidence on how exactly drugs work in brain, it can be successfully treated to help people stop abusing drugs. There are many treatments that help people counteract the disruptive effects of drug addiction and regain complete control over life. Behavioral therapy is the best way to ensure success in most of the drug addicts. The treatment approaches are tailored to meet the drug abuse pattern of patients.

<button class="accordion">16.Climate change/ Global warming</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>In recent years, there have been many alarming reports that the world‘s climate is undergoing a significant change. All these reports provide strong evidence that world temperatures are increasing day by day. This increase in global warming is caused by increased amounts of carbon dioxide  around the earth. Most climatologists believe that the greenhouse effect is the likely cause of this global warming. It is the gradual warming of the air surrounding the earth as a result of heat being trapped by environmental pollution. This is exemplified by the destruction and burning down of tropical rain forests, by traffic that clogs up city streets, by the rapid growth of industry, the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in packaging and manufacturing commercial products, the use of detergents such as washing powder and washing-up liquid and so on. The oceans are also said to be affected both because of human waste and because of pollution caused by industrial waste products, oil seeping from damaged supertankers and from other maritime disasters. However, the main culprits for global warming are carbon dioxide gas, produced by the burning of fossil fuels and forests, and pollutants such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons. Climatologists predict that  midway through the next century, temperatures may have risen by as much as 4°C. This could catastrophically reduce mankind‘s ability to grow food, destroy or severely damage wildlife and wilderness, raise sea levels and thereby flood coastal areas and farmland. The alarming news about Bangladesh is that as a result of the rise of the sea level, the lower southern part of the country may one day go under water.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>Tree-planting is the process of transplanting tree seedlings, generally for forestry & land reclamation. It involves planting seedlings over an area of land . Tree planting is carried out in many different parts of the world. Trees are essential elements for our life. Tree planting can be used as a geo-engineering technique to remove CO2 from the air. Trees are beautiful and useful gifts of nature. They are great friends of man. Trees give us flowers, fruits, timber, bamboo, fuels, etc. They are also a great source of materials for paper, rubber, gums, herbs and medicine plants. Forest brings clouds and cause rainfall. Trees prevent soil erosion. They protect us from severe weather. Trees are a part and parcel of earthly life. All life directly or indirectly owes its existence to them. Trees release oxygen which we need for our life. They also absorb the carbon-dioxide. Many living species live in trees. Trees form the natural habitat of many animals, birds and insects. They help make the land fertile. We get good crops out of fertile land. They are the sources of fruits and flowers. They offer us cool shade during summer. During rainy season, we take shelter under the trees.  Trees and plants are  the sources of many supply life-saving drugs. They prevent land erosion and guard us against pollution. Thus, trees keep up the ecological balance. Seeds, nuts and fruits are food sources for humans and animals. Trees protect the biodiversity of the ecosystem. Thus, trees play an important role in our life. But felling of trees is disturbing the eco-system. We should preserve trees and plants with great care</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>May 1 is internationally observed as May Day. The day is observed to commemorate the historic struggle of working people. The day is observed in most of the countries of the world. The day has a historical background. It originated from the bloody First of May event and subsequent incidents that took place in the streets of Chicago in 1886. On May 1, a labour organisation called an industrial strike, demanding a maximum eight hours of work every day, standard wages, better work environment etc. The strike was suppressed by brutal means. On May 3, the Chicago police fired on striking labourers of the McComick Harvest Machine Company,, killing at least one striker, seriously wounding five or six others and injuring an undetermined number. The International Socialist Congress held on 14 July 1889 designated May 1 as Labour Day, and since then the day has been observed by labouring classes in many countries. May Day has assumed a special significance after the Socialist Revolution in Russia and subsequent revolutions in some other countries. The rights of labourers were recognised by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Most socialist countries observe May Day with all seriousness and determination. But observing the day as a public holiday is not confined to socialist countries. A few non-socialist countries also observe May Day as a public holiday. May Day is celebrated to pay tribute to the contributions workers have made to make the world strong and prosper. This day is dedicated to the workers for their economic and social achievements. On this day, workers arrange rallies and processions not to demonstrate their grievances, but to celebrate the victories that they had been able to achieve in the past.</p>

<p>21 February is a memorable day in our national history. We observe the day every year as International Mother Language Day. The day is a national holiday. On this day, we pay tribute to the martyrs who laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language in undivided Pakistan in 1952. This is known as the Language Movement. The seed of the Language Movement was Sown on 21 March 1948 when Mohammad Ali Zinnah, the then Governor General of Pakistan, at a public meeting in Dhaka declared that Urdu would be the only official language of Pakistan. The declaration raised a storm of protest in the eastern part of the country. The protest continued non-stop, gathering momentum day by day. It turned into a movement and reached its climax in 1952. The government outlawed all sorts of public meetings and rallies to prevent it. The students of Dhaka University defied the law and they brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February 1952. When the procession reached near Dhaka Medical College, the police opened fire on the students, killing Salam, Rafiq, Barkat and Jabbar. This enkindled the sparks of independent movement of Bangladesh. 21 February has been observed as Shaheed Dibosh every year throughout the country in remembrance of the martyrs of language movement of 1952. The occasion begins at the early hours of the day with mourning songs that recall the supreme sacrifices of our language martyrs. People wear black badges and go to the Shaheed Minar barefoot in procession, singing mourning songs. They place wreaths at the Minar. Many of them visit the graves of the martyrs at Azimpur graveyard and pray for them. They also attend various programmes organised in remembrance of the language martyrs.

<div class="panel">
<p>Bangladesh is a land of villages. Her economy is agro-based. Agriculture contributes to our GDP substantially.  So a farmer plays a vital role in the economy of our country. Basically   he is the main force of our economy. A man who works in his fields or other people’s fields for leading his life and family is called a farmer. Generally he lives in a small hut in the village. He is the most common figure in our country. He grows crops and keeps animals. He works very hard. He gets up early in the morning and continues to work till sun sets in the field. He takes his plough and a pair of oxen with him. He does not bother hard labour. But he lives from hand to mouth. Usually he wears old and dirty cloths. He cannot afford to buy  food & clothes for him and his family members. In fact, his life is full of sorrows and sufferings. When he finds no work, he and his family go unfed. He lives below poverty line. He has no silver lining in his life. When he is unable to feed his family members properly, his wife is bound to work in other’s house as a house maid. He and his family lead a sorrowful and miserable life. He has no ambition and hope in life. Due to poverty, they suffer a lot  from malnutrition. He is even unable to educate his children due to acute poverty. A farmer leads a very simple life. His life depends on his land and animals. But all the farmers are not poor. Some of them have big lands and farms. When a farmer grows a good harvest, he enjoys a happy life with his family. His face beams with joy. But when he cannot grow a good harvest, he enjoys a miserable life. Bangladesh has recently attained the status of a developing country. To boost up her economy, priority should be given on the socio- economic condition of the peasantry as a whole.</p>

Sometimes it rains heavily and sometimes it drizzles. Often thunder rumbles in the sky. One cannot go out without an umbrella. Water stands here & there on the roads and streets which become muddy and slippery. Passers-by are often seen walking with umbrellas over their heads, shoes in their hands and clothes folded up to their knees. Birds are hardly seen flying. They keep standing on the branches of trees. Cattle keep standing in their sheds. The rich class of people without any compulsion to go outside enjoy the day having rich and delicious food  at home. The normal day is paralyzed on a rainy day. The rivers and canals become full to the brim. The existing drains in the towns and cities cannot hold the heavy pressure of rainwater and there-by over-flood the low-lying houses and buildings. The poor class of people, especially the day labourers suffer most on a rainy day as they cannot go out for their work. The students and office-goers also suffer on a rainy day because they too have  to go out on a rainy day if there is no alternative.

Early rising gives a man a long lease of life. It gives us wealth. It gives us joy. On the other hand, a man who does not get up early in the morning faces many problems. He may be late for office, may miss plan or even fail to perform his daily works regularly. He always lags behind. He cannot prosper in life. He always feels unwell. He suffers from various diseases. The nature in the morning is completely calm and quiet. So, the early riser can enjoy all these and he can be benefitted. So we should practise early rising from early period of our life.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>Mobile phone is a wireless and small piece of electronic device enabling us to connect any person from anywhere in the world. The mobile phone is a wonderful gift of modern science. Mobile phone has revolutionized our communication and speeded up our life unbelievably. In 2007, the iPhone came out and revolutionised the smart phones. Now the idea of fixed phone is quite simply  obsolete. No more people are satisfied with the limited scope of communication. The mobile phone has enabled us to communicate with anyone anytime anywhere at our will. Mobile phone has virtually become a microcosm of the whole world. The latest technology has made the vast world technology a micro world. A mobile phone now accommodates all that a computer can afford. Though a smart phone cannot yet match the full power and potential of a full fledge computer, it is getting closer everyday. Mobile phone has made the global world more cemented and bonded. Despite these positive aspects, mobile phone has also some real disadvantages. Using mobile phone has become an addiction for the young generations. The students can neglect their studies by spending more time on the mobile phone. Especially the social media applications in modern smart phones are provoking students to spend less time in study and concentrate more on their FAKE social life. Moreover, the teenagers are taking objectionable photograph and porno films, which is bad for them and can mislead them. This misuse should be banned anyhow. Moreover, excessive  use of mobile phone cause radio active exposure” which can cause cancer and damage our hearing. So phones should not be permanently banned from teenagers , but should be highly monitored by their parents . Despite all these demerit’s mobile phone is the inevitability for our day to day life and we cannot help using the mobile phone. After all, we should be just a bit careful using mobile  phone.</p>

<button class="accordion">27.A street beggar</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A street beggar is a very poor person who has to beg for his livelihood. He goes door to door for begging A street beggar is found sitting or standing by the road-side and begging for a small coin. He is seen almost everywhere in towns and cities. He wears torn and patched up clothes. Sometimes he is alone and sometimes he is in company. A mother with a child or two is also sometimes seen. A beggar may be a man or a woman or a child. He/she may be an old, disabled person, or he/she may be an able-bodied person. Whenever he/she sees a passerby, he/she stretches out his/her hand for help. A few among the passers-by stop, give him/her a coin or two and go on their way. Again, some become disgusted with his loud shouts and avoid him. A beggar sometimes follows a passer-by to some distance begging for help. Beggars are after all, poor, miserable fellows. He can't get enough food for his feeding. He has to eat a very little food. Many of them suffer from infectious diseases. They help spread diseases in town and cities. Thus a street beggar us a social problem. It encourages idleness and immorality. The children of the beggars also turn beggars. They grow us as professional beggars. Begging is a social evil. It needs to be banned. It is a cause of concern for our society. A legislation should be enacted to check begging. People should be made aware not to give charity to those who are able-bodied. However, those who deserve to be helped should be properly assisted. They should be provided some sort of employment to become self-reliant.</p>

<button class="accordion">1.A winter Morning</button>
<div class="panel">
 <p> Winter is the coldest season in our country.
 It is usually foggy. Everything looks hazy Sometimes the fog is so dense that nothing can be seen even at a little distance. Everything looks hazy. Nature looks gloomy.
 The chirping of the birds is not heard. 
 The animals cannot come out of their shelters due to dense fog.
 Dense fog causes disruption to the communication system.
 Dew drops fall at night. Sometimes cold waves blow.
 It causes much sufferings to the children, the sick people, the aged people and the poor class.
<br> People put on different kinds of warm clothes to protect themselves from cold. 
Little boys & girls wrap their hands & legs in cold spell. 
The old people and children shiver in cold. 
They gather straw and make fires at different places to warm themselves in the heat.
 Most people do not feel like leaving the bed early.
 Sometimes village people spend the winter morning by gossiping.  In towns, rich people read newspaper in balcony. They drink warm tea while reading newspaper & enjoy sunbath.  The scene of the winter morning vanishes as the day advances.  In winter the days are shorter and the nights are longer. A winter night is more painful than a winter morning. A winter morning brings pains & sufferings to the rootless poor people. In spite of the dark sides of a winter morning we always welcome it because it is rich with varieties of food such as date juice, fresh vegetables and some other things. Villagers make fire with straw to warm themselves. Various kinds of pithas are made in this season. In a winter morning pitha parban is held in towns where the town folk enjoy winter food. A winter morning is not an unmixed blessing. In a winter morning, people go through different experiences according to their economic background. Those who are poor cannot afford warm cloths and so they suffer from the bitter cold. But the rich people enjoy sleep or staying under warm blanket. In cities & towns, different groups of people go picnic in remote areas & enjoy the winter morning in a different way.  So, to the poor the sun-ray becomes more precious than gold. In fact, people of all walks of life enjoy a winter morning despite some natural hazards like cold spell, dense fog etc. Many pitha  festivals are held throughout the country in  winter as the people of our country are fest lovers traditionally. The winter season is always welcome to the people of our country irrespective of class distinction.

<button class="accordion">2.Deforestation</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Deforestation means cutting down trees in large numbers.  It is a process where a forest becomes a non-forest.  There is no denying the fact that deforestation has become a global concern in the present world. Forests are a rich resource of our planet earth. Therefore, it is important to protect our environment. Forests have a great floral diversity. There are large trees, creepers & climbers, grasses, shrubs & bushes that grow in forests. Forests are also habitats to many wild species. A large variety of animals, birds, reptiles and insects live in forests. Forests provide sustenance to many living beings including man. There are many  causes of deforestation. Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world. Its population is much more in proportion to its area. This huge number of population needs more shelter, agricultural land, fuel, furniture etc. For all these reasons, people cut down trees. Man depends on forests for food & livelihood. As farmers need more land for cultivation, they cut down trees to expand their agricultural land.  People also cut trees for habituation. They cut down trees for timber which is used as fuel, for  construction or to make furniture. Deforestation has very drastic effects on both humans and nature. Decreasing  the number of the trees leads to rising carbon-di-oxide and lack of oxygen in the atmosphere. Deforestation results in severe health hazards like  lung diseases,  bronchitis & other respiratory diseases  in humans and animals. All living beings need water. Loss of forest leads to ecological imbalance. Deforestation is one of the major factors leading to the greenhouse effect and desertification. Moreover, there are some greedy people who cut down trees in our forests to make money. The effects of deforestation are too many to describe. This destruction disturbs our ecological balance. Due to deforestation carbon-dioxide is increasing worldwide. As a result, the world is becoming warmer. The sea level is rising. On the other hand, new areas of the world are turning into deserts as a result of deforestation. The removal of trees causes serious damage to the soil. The temperature will rise and it will cause green house effect. The country will be unsuitable for living.  Ecological balance is also disturbed by deforestation. Many wild animals and birds, as well as beasts, lose their home. Global warming is an alarming consequence of deforestation. If we destroy trees at random, one day the country will turn into a great desert. There will be no rain and  our agricultural will face a great crisis As a result temperature of the atmosphere is increasing and ice of the polar region is melting very fast. For this, we have to face various devastating floods. Drought may occur due to deforestation. Our government should take immediate measures to prevent deforestation.

<button class="accordion">3.Environment pollution</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The world is producing millions of tons of domestic rubbish and toxic industrial waste each year, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to find suitable locations to get rid of all the refuse. The disposal of various kinds of waste is seriously polluting the environment. Air is an important element of our environment and our air is polluted by smoke. Man makes fires to cook food, make bricks, melt tar for road construction and to do many other things. Fires create smoke and pollute the air. Railway  engines and powerhouses create smoke by burning coal and oil. Mills and factories also belch a lot of smoke. Buses, trucks and cars use petrol and diesel oil. These too emit smoke. All these kinds of smoke pollute the air. Water, another vital element of the environment, is also polluted in different ways. Man pollutes water by throwing waste into it. Farmers use chemical fertilizers and insecticides in their fields. When rain and floods wash away some of these chemicals, they get mixed with water in rivers, canals and ponds. Mills and factories also throw their poisonous chemicals and waste products into rivers and canals and thus pollute the water. Water vehicles also pollute rivers by dumping oil, food waste and human waste into them. Every year millions of people all over the world die unnecessarily as a result of pollution. These unfortunate and avoidable deaths are brought about  by four specific factors. Firstly, air pollution from factories, burning trash, and vehicle fumes cause pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory diseases. Then, water pollution from industrial discharge. the indiscriminate disposal of toxic chemicals, and the dumping of human waste into rivers and canals causes poisoning and water-borne diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea. The next factor is the noise pollution from vehicle horns and microphones that might cause aggression and damage hearing. And finally, odour pollution from dumped or untreated human waste causes serious discomfort to our sense of smell, and attracts disease-bearing creatures such as rats and flies. We should take  determined action to control these problems and clean up the environment to avert these unnecessary diseases.

<button class="accordion">4.A day labourer</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There is no single definition to describe a day labourer. But the word that comes to us about a day labourer is someone who works manually from early morning till  late evening on a daily basis. In short, a day labourer is he who does heavy manual labour in various fields. He belongs to the marginalized class. He belongs to ultra-poor group.  In most cases, he is unskilled or semi-skilled.  He does not enjoy due social status though he deserves it  and his labour is also  indispensible for the economic development of a country. A day labourer is a known face to all of us as he is required in our daily life. Naturally he is to be healthily, strong and stout  due to the nature of his job.  He lives with his family in a slum. He gets up early in the morning and goes out in search of work. He works hard from dawn to dusk for his employer and gets his wages at evening. He does different types of jobs such as carrying bricks, wood, stones, mud and digging ponds, constructing of roads, buildings etc. Sometimes he and his family pass a day without food if he cannot manage work. However, he is in great demand in harvesting season. . When he earns much money, he and his family can eat well. It is a happy day for them. If he does not find any work, he and his family have to go without food. So the life of a day labourer is very miserable. Sorrows and sufferings are his constant companions. He does not know what joy and happiness are. He earns his living by working hard. Most of the time he is ill- paid and ill- treated in every sphere of his life. In fact, the services of a day laborer plays an importance role in our national life. So we should think about his rights and show respect to them.

<button class="accordion">5.Price-hike</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Price rise is a great problem of the day. It is a common phenomenon not only in our country but also in the world. Today the prices of necessary things such as food items, cloths, education materials, medicine and many other necessary things are going up by leaps and bounds. Price rise is caused by several factors like hoarding, population explosion, low productivity, natural calamities, wars, backwardness of communication, evil motives of dishonest businessmen, smuggling, black marketing etc. If the price rise is caused by the short supply of commodities, it is temporary. But it is very difficult to control the price rise caused by inflation. However, the people of low income suffer greatly and pass their days in constant anxiety. They find it, difficult to make their both ends meet. price hike is a function of multifarious factors such as energy costs, declining dollar value, rising demand for bio-fuel, export restrictions on food grains, carrying cost, climate change, etc. Concerns over oil prices, energy security and climate change have prompted governments to encourage production and use of bio-fuel. The price rise has widened the gap between the export and import value in the food grain importing countries which has affected the terms of trade and foreign exchange reserve. The fiscal impact of this price hike leads to the reduction of taxes on food grain import and a rise in subsidies in the production of the same Price rise has terrible effects on man’s character. It leads people to the path of corruption and moral degradation. The situation is complex and there is no single solution to this problem. The government should perform more efficiently and has to take actions so that the market performs properly. Bangladesh imports a lion’s share of its import of rice from India at low cost. In Bangladesh, the main sources of calorie are rice and wheat. In spite of a rise in wheat and rice price, people still consume rice and wheat. Therefore, the food price rise affects the poor extensively. Food crisis is a national as well as an international problem.  To reduce the extent of the effect of the crisis, some short term and long term measures can be taken. The government should begin selling rice from its stock and import food grains right at this moment to keep the local market stable. The dependency on private food importers should be lessened to avoid the artificial volatility of the local markets. Increasing the adoption of hybrid rice, improving crop management practices and access to high quality seed are essential. Deepening fertilizer dealer network to improve timely access to fertilizer and focusing on high quality seed availability are also needed.. Laws should be enforced strictly to bring the prices of the essential commodities within the purchasing capacity of the common people.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>Food Adulteration refers to the process by which the quality or the nature of a given food is reduced through addition of adulterants or removal of vital substance. Unsafe levels of pesticides are present  in around half of the vegetables and more than a quarter of fruits sold in the capital’s markets, a recent survey has found. The survey report, read that nearly 40% of 82 samples of milk, milk products, fish, fruits and vegetables contained banned pesticides such as DDT, Aldrin, Chlordane and Heptachlor. The amounts of pesticide in these samples were found to be 3 to 20 times greater than the limits set by the European Union. Around 50% vegetables and 35% fruits were found to be contaminated with unsafe level of pesticides. Using a sensitive High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method developed by the Food Safety Lab, 66 samples were analysed for the presence of formaldehyde. Adulteration was thereby detected in samples of coriander, mango and fresh shrimps. The tests indicated that poultry feed in the country had also been contaminated, as samples of chicken and fish contained traces of antibiotics. High microbial populations were found in several samples of pasteurised milk, indicating poor processing procedures by the manufacturers. Samples of cucumber and street foods also showed high microbial populations, suggesting widespread contamination in the water supply. Adulterated food products are reportedly the cause behind thousands of people suffering from fatal diseases like cancer, kidney failure and heart problems. Better monitoring and supervision were mandatory for stopping food adulteration.</p>

<button class="accordion">8.A street hawker</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A street hawker is a very common man in our society. Usually he moves from place to place to sell his goods. In fact, a street hawker is a very simple man. He is very poor and humble. He is a shabby man. He is a small trader. The capital of his business is very small. He lives from hand to mouth. Every morning he goes out to sell his goods carrying them either on his hand or in a cart or van. Throughout the day, he sells his goods shouting at the top of his voice to draw the attention of his customers. A the end of the day, he returns home with  the marginal profit gained from the sold goods. Again he goes out for the next day and returns home almost in the same way. Truly speaking, he leads his life in the vicious cycle of poverty. In fact, there is no liver lining in his life. He finds it very difficult to maintain his family. He can’t afford to meet the basic needs of life. Basically, he adopts a technique to sell his goods. He applies his skill to motivate or convince his customers especially women & children who are his first priority. It is true that the importance of a hawker goes unnoticed in our society. The fact is that he belongs to the marginalized class and his business is so petty that it is not included in the mainstream economy. Still he is part & parcel of our society. So we should have positive mindset for him</p>

<button class="accordion">9.Traffic jam</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Traffic jam means a long line of vehicles that cannot move or that can move very slowly. It is a common affair in the big cities of our country. We’ve all experienced being stuck in a traffic jam, a stream of cars for miles ahead of us and behind us. Lack of co-ordination among government organizations and haphazard public transport system which includes lack of provision for pedestrians and poor maintenance and management of footways are the root cause of traffic jam. Rapid growth of population and the increasing number of vehicles are also the causes of traffic jam. Vehicles are much more than the roads can accommodate. The indiscriminate playing of rickshaw is another cause of it. Haphazard parking, more private vehicles, violation of traffic rules, faulty road construction, haphazard crossing, VIP movement, over population, rail crossing and fuel station are also the causes of traffic jam in the big cities city. Traffic jam causes untold sufferings to people. Sometimes it raises our tension. Transport and urban experts think the government should take pragmatic steps to ensure sufficient mass transport, restore discipline in the transport sector, reduce the use of private and small vehicles, replace the microbuses and minibuses with single-decker, double-decker and articulated buses and expand the capital city to significantly ease the traffic jam without spending huge money. The railways and waterways can also be used effectively to ease traffic pressure on roads and facilitate the commuters hassle-free transportation services. We have built over a half dozens of flyovers, but it is not a solution to the problem. It will not be possible to reduce traffic jam without increasing public transport and ensuring better traffic management. It is also necessary to implement all mass transit-related projects with high priority to improve traffic situation.</p>

<button class="accordion">10.Load-shedding</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The term ‘load shedding’ means the state of being no electricity due to demand supply gap of power for a certain period in a certain area. The energy infrastructure of Bangladesh is quite small, insufficient and poorly managed. Electricity is the major source of power for most of the economic activities of a country. In generating & distributing power, the failure to adequately manage the loads leads to load-shedding which causes severe disruption in the industrial production and other economic activities. Inefficient distribution system is a major hurdle in delivering power. It is estimated that the total transmission and distribution losses in Bangladesh amount to one-third of the total generation. The process of upgrading the grid technology to digital smart metering system is going on throughout the country to reduce system loss. It will reduce power cuts and provide stability to the power sector. Radio technology can be operated remotely to maintain multiple power flow lines with automated control & digital metering. Load shedding causes multiple hazards in our socio-economic life. During load shedding the whole area plunges into darkness. Houses, shops, mills, factories, hospitals & almost all infrastructures are paralyzed for the time being. Students cannot prepare their lessons. Doctors cannot operate upon emergency patients in hospitals. Mills & factories cannot run their machines. Farmers cannot operate their agricultural tools in corn fields. Everything comes to a stand-still due to load-shedding. So, pragmatic steps should be taken to reduce system loss & keep load shedding at a tolerable level. The old power plants should be replaced. Nuclear plant is the best solution to power crisis to  meet the growing demand of the consumers. Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant is an under construction nuclear power plant in our country. It is expected that power crisis is going to be solved in Bangladesh.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>A road accident is the most vulnerable, unexpected incident in human life. It is a regular phenomenon in the highways and cities of our country. Every year it kills hundreds of lives. In Bangladesh, every day we find the news of road accidents in our daily newspapers and on television screen . It really makes us very shocked. Last month I saw a tragic road accident. It occurred in Mirpur Road near the Kolabagan Bus Stand. When I was standing on the road and waiting for the bus, I saw a little boy trying to cross the busy road. While crossing the road, the ill-fated boy was run over by a speedy truck When he was taken to the hospital, the doctor declared him dead. I cannot forget the tragic accident. A number of factors are responsible for road accidents in our country. First of all, the roads and streets of our country are narrow. These streets are not straight as there are frequent turnings at short distances. Reckless driving often causes road accidents. Besides, drivers are careless about the traffic rules and regulations. They recklessly drive their vehicles. Most of the drivers are not well- trained and in addition , they have not any adequate knowledge of the traffic system. Last but not the least, the pedestrians are also responsible for street accidents. They cross roads here and there. To save the pedestrians, drivers sometimes lose control and consequently accidents occur. Moreover, the condition of all vehicles is not up to the mark. So, plying of these defective vehicles is another factor of street accident. However, road accidents cause irreparable loss and injure. The effect of a road accident is too pathetic to describe. People lose their near and dear ones forever. The injured people due to accidents become a burden to the family. To control road accident, the defective vehicles should not be allowed to ply on the roads. Reckless driving should also be severely dealt with. Streets and roads should be expanded. Not only that, proper planning is needed at the time of constructing roads. Modern and scientific traffic system should be introduced in towns and cities. Last of all, the driving license should be issued after proper training and test. If all these steps can be taken properly, it will help to minimize road accidents. Above all, the people should be made aware of the bad consequences of road accident to control it to a great extent.</p>

<p>Drug addiction means a strong desire for a drug which the addict cannot resist. Narcotics like Opium, Heroin, Marijuana, Hashish, LSD and Cocaine are used by the addict. When the person takes them, he gets excited and loses control over himself. Drug addiction has become a worldwide problem, especially in teenagers. Many young people become dependent on different types substances and stimulating medicines that comes hand-in-hand with narcotic effect.
Drug addiction is basically a brain disease that changes the functioning of brain. There is an uncontrollable desire to consume drugs, as a result of which addicted people engage in compulsive behavior to take drugs. The addicts find it impossible to control the intake of drugs, as a result of which they fail to fulfill day-to-day responsibilities in efficient manner. Drug addiction is also referred as drug dependency, as the addict develops dependency for particular substance.
The most common signs and symptoms of drug addiction are – obsession with a particular substance, loss of control over the usage of drugs, abandoning the activities which you used to enjoy, etc. Drug addiction may have long term impact on life and one may develop severe symptoms such as – fatigue, trembling, depression, anxiety, headache, insomnia, chills and sweating, paranoia, behavior changes, dilated pupils, poor coordination problems, nausea etc.
Though there is no scientific evidence on how exactly drugs work in brain, it can be successfully treated to help people stop abusing drugs. There are many treatments that help people counteract the disruptive effects of drug addiction and regain complete control over life. Behavioral therapy is the best way to ensure success in most of the drug addicts. The treatment approaches are tailored to meet the drug abuse pattern of patients. It is not uncommon for an individual to relapse and start drug abuse again. In such case, an alternate treatment is required to regain control and recover completely.

<div class="panel">
<p>In recent years, there have been many alarming reports that the world‘s climate is undergoing a significant change. All these reports provide strong evidence that world temperatures are increasing day by day. This increase in global warming is caused by increased amounts of carbon dioxide  around the earth. Most climatologists believe that the greenhouse effect is the likely cause of this global warming. It is the gradual warming of the air surrounding the earth as a result of heat being trapped by environmental pollution. This is exemplified by the destruction and burning down of tropical rain forests, by traffic that clogs up city streets, by the rapid growth of industry, the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in packaging and manufacturing commercial products, the use of detergents such as washing powder and washing-up liquid and so on. The oceans are also said to be affected both because of human waste and because of pollution caused by industrial waste products, oil seeping from damaged supertankers and from other maritime disasters. However, the main culprits for global warming are carbon dioxide gas, produced by the burning of fossil fuels and forests, and pollutants such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons. Climatologists predict that  midway through the next century, temperatures may have risen by as much as 4°C. This could catastrophically reduce mankind‘s ability to grow food, destroy or severely damage wildlife and wilderness, raise sea levels and thereby flood coastal areas and farmland. The alarming news about Bangladesh is that as a result of the rise of the sea level, the lower southern part of the country may one day go under water.</p>

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
  May Day or International Workers Day is observed on May 1 all over the world today to commemorate the historical struggle and sacrifices of the working people to establish an eight-hour workday. It is a public holiday in almost all the countries of the world. Since the Industrial Revolution(1) in the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the US, the workers in mills and factories had been working a long shift, fourteen or even more hours a day. On May 1st in 1886, inspired by the trade unions(2), half of the workers at the  Mc Cormic Harvester Company in Chicago went on strike demanding an eight-hour workday. Two days later, a workers’ rally was held near the Mc Cormic Harvester Company and about 6000 workers had joined it. The rally was addressed by the labour leaders. They urged the workers to stand together, to go on with their struggle and not to give in to their bosses. Just at this moment some strikebreakers started leaving the meeting place.

Traditional childhood pastimes of climbing trees and playing conkers are in decline,
according to survey by the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds).
 It’s a charitable organisation registered in England and Wales. 
 The survey shows that people under 34 recall far fewer such childhood outdoor experiences than their counterparts over 55, according to a survey by RSPB.
 People were asked which of 12 outdoor experiences they could remember during their childhood. 
 The answer included making dens, daisy chains, climbing trees, playing conkers and feeding birds.
 Four out of five boys climbed trees and the same number of girls made daisy chains. 
 But the survey showed the numbers declining among the newer generations.
 Some 15% more of those aged over 55 had these outdoor experiences in their childhood,
 compared with those between 15-34 years old. Some 92% of the public agreed that 
 experiences of nature were still important to children, and 82% agreed that schools should play a role in providing them to all children.
 The survey has highlighted the positive impact of contact with nature on a child's education, health, wellbeing and social skills.
 At the same time, there has been a decline in these opportunities, with negative consequences for children, 
 families and society - a condition now known as nature deficit disorder. Mike Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB, 
 will meet parliament members on Tuesday to urge the government to join other organisations in providing children with first-hand experiences
 of the natural environment. … "We believe this guidance should include the many positive impacts to children of having
 contact with nature and learning outside the classroom." <br>

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
  May Day or International Workers Day is observed on May 1 all over the world today to commemorate the historical struggle and sacrifices of the working people to establish an eight-hour workday. It is a public holiday in almost all the countries of the world. Since the Industrial Revolution(1) in the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the US, the workers in mills and factories had been working a long shift, fourteen or even more hours a day. On May 1st in 1886, inspired by the trade unions(2), half of the workers at the  Mc Cormic Harvester Company in Chicago went on strike demanding an eight-hour workday. Two days later, a workers’ rally was held near the Mc Cormic Harvester Company and about 6000 workers had joined it. The rally was addressed by the labour leaders. They urged the workers to stand together, to go on with their struggle and not to give in to their bosses. Just at this moment some strikebreakers started leaving the meeting place. The strikers went down the street to bring them back. Suddenly about 200 policemen attacked them with clubs and revolvers. One striker was killed instantly, five or six others were seriously wounded and many of them were badly injured. The events of May 1, 1886 is a reminder that workers will continue to be exploited until they stand up and speak out to gain better working conditions, better pay and better lives

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
 21 February is a memorable day in our national history. We observe the day every
year as International Mother Language Day. The day is a national holiday.
On this day, we pay tribute to the martyrs who laid down their lives to establish
Bangla as a state language in undivided Pakistan in 1952. This is known as the
Language Movement.
The seed of the Language Movement was Sown on 21 March 1948 when
Mohammad Ali Zinnah, the then Governor General of Pakistan, at a public meeting
in Dhaka declared that Urdu would be the only official language of Pakistan. The
declaration raised a storm of protest in the eastern part of the country. The protest
continued non-stop, gathering momentum day by day. It turned into a movement and
reached its climax in 1952. The government outlawed all sorts of public meetings and
rallies to prevent it.
The students of Dhaka University defied the law and they brought out a peaceful
protest procession on 21 February 1952. When the procession reached near Dhaka
Medical College, the police opened fire on the students, killing Salam, Rafiq, Barkat
and Jabbar. This enkindled the sparks of independent movement of Bangladesh.

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
 21 February has been observed as Shaheed Dibosh every year throughout the country
in remembrance of the martyrs of language movement of 1952. The occasion begins
at the early hours of the day with mourning songs that recall the supreme sacrifices of
our language martyrs. People wear black badges and go to the Shaheed Minar
barefoot in procession, singing mourning songs. They place wreaths at the Minar.
Many of them visit the graves of the martyrs at Azimpur graveyard and pray for
them. They also attend various programmes organised in remembrance of the
language martyrs.
The UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) on
17 November in 1999 proclaimed February 21 as the International Mother Language

Traditional childhood pastimes of climbing trees and playing conkers are in decline,
according to survey by the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds).
 It’s a charitable organisation registered in England and Wales. 
 The survey shows that people under 34 recall far fewer such childhood outdoor experiences than their counterparts over 55, according to a survey by RSPB.
 People were asked which of 12 outdoor experiences they could remember during their childhood. 
 The answer included making dens, daisy chains, climbing trees, playing conkers and feeding birds.
 Four out of five boys climbed trees and the same number of girls made daisy chains. 
 But the survey showed the numbers declining among the newer generations.
 Some 15% more of those aged over 55 had these outdoor experiences in their childhood,
 compared with those between 15-34 years old. Some 92% of the public agreed that 
 experiences of nature were still important to children, and 82% agreed that schools should play a role in providing them to all children.
 The survey has highlighted the positive impact of contact with nature on a child's education, health, wellbeing and social skills.
 At the same time, there has been a decline in these opportunities, with negative consequences for children, 
 families and society - a condition now known as nature deficit disorder. Mike Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB, 
 will meet parliament members on Tuesday to urge the government to join other organisations in providing children with first-hand experiences
 of the natural environment. … "We believe this guidance should include the many positive impacts to children of having
 contact with nature and learning outside the classroom." <br>

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
  Meherjan lives in a slum on the Sirajgonj Town Protection Embankment. Her polythene roofed shelter looks like a cage. She is nearly 45 but looks more than her age. In front of her shelter, she is trying to make a fire to cook the day’s only meal. Her weak hands tremble as she adds some fallen leaves and straw to the fire. The whispering wind from the river Jamuna makes the fire unsteady. The dancing of the flames reminds Meherjan of the turmoil in her life. Not long ago Meherjan had everything--- a family, cultivable land and cattle. The erosion of the Jamuna consumed gradually all her landed property. It finally claimed her last shelter during the last monsoon. It took the river only a day to demolish Meher’s house, trees, vegetable garden and the bamboo bush. She had a happy family once. Over the years, she lost her husband and her family to diseases that cruel hunger and poverty brought to the family. Now, she is the only one left to live on with the loss and the pain. The greedy Jamuna has shattered her dreams and happiness. There are thousand others waiting to share the same fate with Meherjan. Bangladesh is a land of rivers that affect its people. Erosion is a harsh reality for the people living along the river banks. During each monsoon many more villages are threatened by the roaring of rivers like the Jamuna, the Padma and the Meghna. It is estimated that river erosion makes at least 100,000 people homeless every year in Bangladesh. In fact, river erosion is one of the main dangers caused by climate change. If we can’t take prompt actions to adapt to climate change, there will be thousands of more Meherjans in our towns and villages every year.

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
The Republic of Maldives is an island country in the Indian Ocean. It has 1199 islands that are clustered into 26 major atolls. An atoll is a ring-shaped coral reef or a string of closely spaced coral islands. The natural coral reefs of Maldives surrounded by lagoons make each island stand out as a pearl in the Indian Ocean. The Maldives stand at eighth position amongst the smallest countries in the world with an area of 300 square kilometres only. It is also the smallest Asian country with respect to population and size. People have been living on the islands of the Maldives from as long as 3000 years ago. They set sail from different parts of the world- Asia, Arabia, Europe and the Americas- to come to these islands. The earliest settlers of the Maldives were probably from southern India and Sri Lanka who came to these islands in the fourth and fifth centuries BC. In the 12th century AD, sailors from East Africa and Arab countries came to the Maldives. As a result, the Maldivians who were originally Buddhists were converted to Sunni Islam in the mid-12th century. In 1344 Ibn Batuta, a famous Arab historian and scholar travelled around the Maldives.
In the 16th century, the Portuguese conquered the Maldives and they ruled the country for 15 years. Although governed as an independent Islamic sultanate for most of its history from 1153 to 1968, the Maldives was a British colony from 1887 to 1965. Following independence from Britain in 1965, the sultanate continued to operate for another 3 years. On November 11, 1968, it was abolished and replaced by a republic and the country assumed its present name. The Maldives is famous as a tourist destination because of its enjoyable weather, heavenly beaches and lagoons, luxurious holiday resorts and the peace-loving people. Being an island country, it enjoys a pleasant weather throughout the year. The Maldives has been ranked as the best country brand for beach, rest and relaxation in 2008. In the same year, it was also ranked second as the best country brand for natural beauty.
The Maldives is well known for being the lowest country in the world. Unfortunately, this small country with idyllic natural beauty is under threat from rising sea levels due to global warming. Most of the country is just 1.5 metres above sea level with a highest point of 2.3 metres! Many predictions have been made with respect to Maldives being swept away by the rising water level in the Indian Ocean. It was even seen during the tsunami of 2004, that many of the island's dry parts were flooded by waters shrinking the island. The government of the Maldives has begun to purchase land from nearby countries in case the islands go under water!

Traditional childhood pastimes of climbing trees and playing conkers are in decline,
according to survey by the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds).
 It’s a charitable organisation registered in England and Wales. 
 The survey shows that people under 34 recall far fewer such childhood outdoor experiences than their counterparts over 55, according to a survey by RSPB.
 People were asked which of 12 outdoor experiences they could remember during their childhood. 
 The answer included making dens, daisy chains, climbing trees, playing conkers and feeding birds.
 Four out of five boys climbed trees and the same number of girls made daisy chains. 
 But the survey showed the numbers declining among the newer generations.
 Some 15% more of those aged over 55 had these outdoor experiences in their childhood,
 compared with those between 15-34 years old. Some 92% of the public agreed that 
 experiences of nature were still important to children, and 82% agreed that schools should play a role in providing them to all children.
 The survey has highlighted the positive impact of contact with nature on a child's education, health, wellbeing and social skills.
 At the same time, there has been a decline in these opportunities, with negative consequences for children, 
 families and society - a condition now known as nature deficit disorder. Mike Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB, 
 will meet parliament members on Tuesday to urge the government to join other organisations in providing children with first-hand experiences
 of the natural environment. … "We believe this guidance should include the many positive impacts to children of having
 contact with nature and learning outside the classroom." <br>

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
  The pioneer of Bangladeshi modern art Zainul Abedin is widely acclaimed for his Bengal ‘Famine Sketches’.
Through a series of sketches, Zainul not only documented the harsh famine of 1940 but also showed
its sinister face through the skeletal figures of the people destined to die of starvation in a man-made
plight. He depicted these extremely shocking pictures with human compassion. He made his own ink by
burning charcoal and using cheap ordinary packing paper for sketching. He produced a series of brush and
ink drawings, which later became iconic images of human sufferings. Zainul developed a knack for drawing and painting when he was a high school student. After completing high school, he got admission to the Government School of
Art, Calcutta (now Kolkata). He graduated with the first position in first class in 1938. He was appointed teacher of the Art School while he was still a student there. He also attended the Slade School of Arts, London in 1951-52. Zainul Abedin is considered the founding father of Bangladeshi art. He was an artist of outstanding talent and earned international reputation. For his artistic and visionary qualities, he is referred to as Shilpacharya meaning ‘great teacher of art’ in Bangladesh. He was the first Principal of the first art school in Dhaka in East
Pakistan (now Bangladesh). He organized the Nabanna (harvest) exhibition in 1969. In the exhibition, a 65-foot long scroll portraying the rural East Pakistan in phases from abundance to poverty. This intensified the already heightened non-cooperation movement against the Pakistan regime. The exhibition was symbolic of the artists’
protest and a milestone in demanding cultural and political freedom. Zainul’s English For Today 105dynamic style of work is evident in a 30 foot long scroll painting called Manpura, which was done to commemorate the death of hundreds and thousands of people in the devastating cyclone of 1970. He designed the pages of Constitution of Bangladesh. He founded the Folk Art Museum at Sonargoan, and also Zainul Abedin Shangrahasala, a gallery of his own
works in Mymensing in 1975. The river Brahmaputra plays a predominant role in his paintings and a source of
inspiration all through his career. Much of his childhood was spent near the scenic beauty of the river Brahmaputra. A series of water colours that Zainul did as his tribute to the river earned him the Governor’s Gold Medal in an all-India exhibition in 1938. This was the first time when he came into spotlight and this award gave him
the confidence to create his own visual style. Zainul was born in Kishoreganj on 29 December 1914 and died on 28 May 1976.

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
 Partha Pratim Majumder was born in 1954 in Pabna to a family of artistes. He spent
most of his early years in his ancestral home, one of the biggest houses, situated in a
small locality known as Kalachandpara. At that time Kalachandpara was well known
for its cultural activities. There were festivals and various types of cultural shows
round the year. Majumder’s father, a photographer by profession was an art lover. He
taught and inspired his son to appreciate different forms of art.
Majumder went to live with his aunt in Chandernagar, 30 kilometres away from
Kolkata in 1966. It was there that he first came across a mime artiste named Jogesh
Dutta. The way Dutta narrated stories without uttering a single word, left Majumder
spellbound. He took lessons on mime from Dutta in Jogesh Dutta's mime academy in
Kolkata from 1966 to 1972.

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
 Mother Teresa was moved by the presence of the sick and dying on the streets of
Kolkata. She founded the home for the dying destitute and named it ‘Nirmal Hridoy’,
meaning ‘Pure Heart’. She and her fellow nuns gathered the dying people off the
streets of Kolkata and brought them to this home. They were lovingly looked after
118 English For Today
_
and cared for. Since then men, women and children have been taken from the streets
and carried to Nirmol Hridoy. T hese unloved and uncared for people get an
opportunity to die in an environment of kindness and love. In their last hours they get
human and Divine love, and can feel they are also children of God. Those who
survive, the Missionaries of Charity try to find jobs for them or send them to homes
where they can live happily for some more years in a caring environment. Regarding
commitment to family, Mother Teresa said, “ Maybe in our own family, we have
somebody, who is feeling lonely, who is feeling sick, who is feeling worried. Are we
there? Are we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families, or do we
put our interest first? We must remember that love begins at home and we must also
remember that future of humanity passes through the family”.
Mother Teresa's work has been recognised throughout the world and she has received
a number of awards. These include the Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971), the
Nehru Prize for Promotion of International Peace & Understanding (1972), the
Balzan Prize (1978), the Nobel Peace Prize (1979) and the Bharat Ratna (1980).
Mother Teresa died at the age of 87, on 5 September 1997.The world salutes her for
her love and compassion for humanity. She has taught us how to extend our hand
towards those who need our love and support irrespective of creed, caste and
religion. Draped in a white and blue-bordered sari, wrinkled face, ever soft eyes and
a saintly smile, is the picture of Mother Teresa in our mind.

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
Steven Paul Jobs ( 24 February 1955 – 5 October 2011) , most popularly known as Steve Jobs was the co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Apple Inc. He was the pioneer of the personal computer revolution. He was famous for his career in the electronic field of computers and consumers. This became possible through the marketing of Apple computers. In 1985, Jobs left Apple after losing a power battle with the board of directors. He then founded NeXT, a computer platform development company specializing in the higher education and business market. On the other hand, Apple failed to bring up any new operating system during Job’s absence. Jobs returned to Apple as an adviser, and took control of the company as an interim CEO. By 1998, Jobs brought back Apple to profitability from the verge of bankruptcy. He supervised the development of iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone and iPad. These devices are so simple and user friendly that even a child can operate them. He supervised the company’s Apple Stores, iTunes Store and the App Store too. The success of these products and services brought about steady financial returns for several years and pushed Apple to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company in 2011. This triumph is regarded as the greatest turnarounds in the business history. Steve Jobs has been highly acclaimed as a visionary leader. Jobs has changed people’s perspective computer, and how they use it, consume personal media, and how they communicate with each other. Hence i-Books, i-Phones, i-Pods and i-Pads have become extremely popular. Jobs saw and felt the need of Wi-Fi (wireless internet connection) in laptops. It is who made Wi-Fi a standard feature of every laptop, and of many other devices worldwide. So Jobs’ dream to be anywhere anytime became a reality. Jobs also co-founded and served as chief executive of Pixar Animation Studios. He became a member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company in 2006, when Disney acquired Pixar.

Traditional childhood pastimes of climbing trees and playing conkers are in decline,
according to survey by the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds).
 It’s a charitable organisation registered in England and Wales. 
 The survey shows that people under 34 recall far fewer such childhood outdoor experiences than their counterparts over 55, according to a survey by RSPB.
 People were asked which of 12 outdoor experiences they could remember during their childhood. 
 The answer included making dens, daisy chains, climbing trees, playing conkers and feeding birds.
 Four out of five boys climbed trees and the same number of girls made daisy chains. 
 But the survey showed the numbers declining among the newer generations.
 Some 15% more of those aged over 55 had these outdoor experiences in their childhood,
 compared with those between 15-34 years old. Some 92% of the public agreed that 
 experiences of nature were still important to children, and 82% agreed that schools should play a role in providing them to all children.
 The survey has highlighted the positive impact of contact with nature on a child's education, health, wellbeing and social skills.
 At the same time, there has been a decline in these opportunities, with negative consequences for children, 
 families and society - a condition now known as nature deficit disorder. Mike Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB, 
 will meet parliament members on Tuesday to urge the government to join other organisations in providing children with first-hand experiences
 of the natural environment. … "We believe this guidance should include the many positive impacts to children of having
 contact with nature and learning outside the classroom." <br>

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
  ‘Heritage’ is what we inherit from the past, live with them in the present and then pass on to our children or future generation. Our unique source of life and inspiration is our cultural and natural heritage. When we speak of ‘World Heritage’, it indicates places and sites that we got from the past and pass on to the future generation of the entire world. The ‘Shat Gambuj Mosque’ in Bagerhat is such a heritage. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985.Originally, the historic Mosque City was known as ‘ Khalifatabad’. It is situated at the outskirts of Bagerhat town--- not very far from the dense mangrove forest of the Sundarbans. Khalifatabad was a Muslim colony. It was founded by the Turkish general, a saint warrior Ulugh Khan Jahan in the 15th century. The infrastructure ofthe city reveals significant technical skills in many mosques as well as early Islamic monuments. Baked bricks are used for the construction of the buildings. The planning of the city is distinctly dominated by Islamic architecture and the decorations are a combination of Mughal and Turkish architecture. Khan Jahan built a network of roads, bridges, public buildings and reservoirs to make the city habitable. There are about 360 mosques in the city. Among them the most remarkable is the multi-domed Shat Gombuj Mosque. The mosque is unique in the sense that it has 60 pillars that support the roof, with 77 low height domes. The 4 towers at 4 corners have smaller domes on the roof as well. The vast prayer hall has 11 arched doorways on the east and 7 each on the north and south for light and ventilation. It has 7 aisles running along the length of the mosque and 11 deep curves between the slender stone columns. These columns support the curving arches created by the domes. The thickness of the arches is 6 feet and have slightly narrowing hollow and round wall. The west wall in the interior has 11 ‘mihrabs’ (niche in mosque pointing towards Makkah). These mihrabs are decorated with stonework and terracotta. The floor of the mosque is made of brick. Besides being used as a prayer hall, Khan Jahan used the mosque as his court also. Today, it is one of the greatest tourist attractions and one of the best architectural beauties of Bangladesh.

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
 Paharpur is an important archaeological site situated in a village named ‘Paharpur’ in
Naogaon district of northern Bangladesh. Naogoan is mainly plain land but in the middle
of it stood a hill covered with jungle. When the jungle was cleared and the hill
excavated, there emerged a lofty ruin of an ancient temple. The temple is about 24 metre
high from the surrounding level. ‘Pahar’ means hill. Hence is the name Paharpur.
The Paharpur site has been excavated and re-excavated a number of times by
archaeologists. Sir Alexander visited the place in 1879. Cunningham intended to
carry out an extensive excavation but was prevented by the land owner. Nevertheless,
he was satisfied with whatever excavation he was permitted to carry on. He
discovered the ruins of a square tower of 22 feet side with a projection in the middle
of each side from the top of the central hill. The site was declared to be protected by
the Archaeological Survey of India in 1919 under the Ancient Monuments
Preservation Act of 1904.
128 English For Today
_
Systematic and regular excavation started jointly by Archaeological Survey of India, and
Varendra Research Society of Rajshahi and Kolkata ( at that time known as Calcutta)
University in 1923. They excavated the south-west corner of the monastery. Next in
1925-26, R D Banerjee excavated the northern part of the central mound. From 1926-27
onward excavation was carried out under the supervision of KN Dikshit.
The Department of Archaeology of Bangladesh brought the site under further
excavation after independence. The operations took place in two phases. The first
phase was initiated in 1981-82 and continued to 1984-1985. The second phase was
started in 1988-89 and continued to 1990-91.

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
 The advantages of the Internet technology have made it possible to emerge a good number of web sites to facilitate social relations among people around the world. These are known as social networking services or social networks. At present, Facebook is the most popular. Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. are other frequently used social services. Social network services are web-based and hence, provide ways for the users to interact through the Internet. These services make it possible to connect people sharing interests and activities across the borders and thus have made a lot for the users to feel that they really live in a global village.
Why are social networks expanding so fast? The answer is simple. Most of the social l services are cost free. You can make use of them free, paying a very little to your Internet service provider. Secondly, you can make your personal profile public before the entire online community. It is like presenting yourself before the entire world. You can also look into other people’s profile if you are interested. It is simple and easy. Thirdly, social networks allow users to upload pictures, multimedia contents and modify the profile. Some like Facebook allow users to update their profiles. Fourthly, networks allow users to post blog entries. User profiles have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users. Finally, there are privacy protection measures too. A user himself or herself decides over the number of visitors/viewers, and what information should be shared with others.

Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
 The advantages of the Internet technology have made it possible to emerge a good number of web sites to facilitate social relations among people around the world. These are known as social networking services or social networks. At present, Facebook is the most popular. Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. are other frequently used social services. Social network services are web-based and hence, provide ways for the users to interact through the Internet. These services make it possible to connect people sharing interests and activities across the borders and thus have made a lot for the users to feel that they really live in a global village.
Why are social networks expanding so fast? The answer is simple. Most of the social l services are cost free. You can make use of them free, paying a very little to your Internet service provider. Secondly, you can make your personal profile public before the entire online community. It is like presenting yourself before the entire world. You can also look into other people’s profile if you are interested. It is simple and easy. Thirdly, social networks allow users to upload pictures, multimedia contents and modify the profile. Some like Facebook allow users to update their profiles. Fourthly, networks allow users to post blog entries. User profiles have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users. Finally, there are privacy protection measures too. A user himself or herself decides over the number of visitors/viewers, and what information should be shared with others.

Traditional childhood pastimes of climbing trees and playing conkers are in decline,
according to survey by the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds).
 It’s a charitable organisation registered in England and Wales. 
 The survey shows that people under 34 recall far fewer such childhood outdoor experiences than their counterparts over 55, according to a survey by RSPB.
 People were asked which of 12 outdoor experiences they could remember during their childhood. 
 The answer included making dens, daisy chains, climbing trees, playing conkers and feeding birds.
 Four out of five boys climbed trees and the same number of girls made daisy chains. 
 But the survey showed the numbers declining among the newer generations.
 Some 15% more of those aged over 55 had these outdoor experiences in their childhood,
 compared with those between 15-34 years old. Some 92% of the public agreed that 
 experiences of nature were still important to children, and 82% agreed that schools should play a role in providing them to all children.
 The survey has highlighted the positive impact of contact with nature on a child's education, health, wellbeing and social skills.
 At the same time, there has been a decline in these opportunities, with negative consequences for children, 
 families and society - a condition now known as nature deficit disorder. Mike Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB, 
 will meet parliament members on Tuesday to urge the government to join other organisations in providing children with first-hand experiences
 of the natural environment. … "We believe this guidance should include the many positive impacts to children of having
